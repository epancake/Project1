        <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
        <p>A discussion on all things Javascript, featuring 2 lightning talks:

            <li>Google Dev Tools 2.0</li>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>CSS variables are amazing! I'm actually a bit surprised that they are "new" since they seem like an obvious feature. You can reuse variables in a CSS stylesheet so that you can change them all at once. And, unlike Sass, the variables can change at runtime as the user interacts with the site. For instance, if there is a color slider on the screen, the user can use the slider to reset the variable on the fly.</p>
        <p>Google Dev Tools 2.0 are amazing! Most of this was over my head, but I did find it really cool that in the Chrome Console you can type out a function and Chrome automatically knows when you push enter if you want to just continue onto a new line or submit your content to a console. For instance if you type:</p>
        <p>"function myFunction(args) {"</p>
        <p>and then hit enter, the console is smart enough to just take you to the next line instead of submitting your code into the console to run. It will also indent and format everything automagically for the rest of the function until your closing curly bracket. Super!</p>

        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In the real world (not school), why you would write functions in the console or create breakpoints. Why wouldn't you just use repl or your actual js file?</li>
          <li>Why do companies pay for the pizza at these meetups? I can think of a few reasons (because the want Denver to be a cool tech environment? or they want for prospective employees to think they are cool?) but I'm not sure the real reason.</li>
          <li>What is Sass and should I be using it?</li>

        <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
        <p>A meetup where people come together to code for the community.

        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Tomasina - Tomasina works at Granikus and she is a former Turing student. She works on React apps at Granicus (a government web services company) and is on the Code for Denver project team called Re:Imagine, a recycling app.</li>
            <li>Fred - It was Fred's first time at the meetup. He's a web dev student at DU.</li>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>Code for Denver is a socially minded group that works with the community to create technology solutions. Current projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An app that will help people petition landlords for recycling</li>
          <li>An app that will help connect musicians with elderly</li>
          <li>A gallery of content to assist K-12 teachers with technology learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://waffle.io/codefordenver/projects">All projects are listed ona cool waffle board here:</a></p>
        <p>I sat with the group working on the recycling app called Re:Imagine. which is a React app. I didn't even know what React was, but I got to look at the app's code and get a little tour of how it is a little like javascript AND html AND CSS combined. I also got to see a tour of the apps wireframes which are wonderful!!! The wireframes were made in Adobe XD (not a free service).</p>

        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How do they decide what people to put on what project? It seems like there are a very specific number of technologies and programming languages used.</li>
          <li>How do they pitch and approve a new project?</li>
