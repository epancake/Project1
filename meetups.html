      <h3>Code for Denver <time datetime="2017-10-30">10/30/2017</time></h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
        <p>A meetup where people come together to code for the community.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Tomasina - Tomasina works at Granikus and she is a former Turing student. She works on React apps at Granicus (a government web services company) and is on the Code for Denver project team called Re:Imagine, a recycling app.</li>
            <li>Fred - It was Fred's first time at the meetup. He's a web dev student at DU.</li>
          </ol>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>Code for Denver is a socially minded group that works with the community to create technology solutions. Current projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An app that will help people petition landlords for recycling</li>
          <li>An app that will help connect musicians with elderly</li>
          <li>A gallery of content to assist K-12 teachers with technology learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://waffle.io/codefordenver/projects">All projects are listed ona cool waffle board here:</a></p>
        <p>I sat with the group working on the recycling app called Re:Imagine. which is a React app. I didn't even know what React was, but I got to look at the app's code and get a little tour of how it is a little like javascript AND html AND CSS combined. I also got to see a tour of the apps wireframes which are wonderful!!! The wireframes were made in Adobe XD (not a free service).</p>

        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How do they decide what people to put on what project? It seems like there are a very specific number of technologies and programming languages used.</li>
          <li>How do they pitch and approve a new project?</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
        <p>A discussion on all things Javascript, featuring 2 lightning talks:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>CSS Variables</li>
          <li>Google Dev Tools 2.0</li>

      <section>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Martin - an analyst at RTD </li>
            <li>Guillermo - One of the presenters, a Galvanize grad who works at Voalte</li>
            <li>Maggie and her buddy - Students at General Assembly, halfway through their 14 week web dev course</li>
          </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>CSS variables are amazing! I'm actually a bit surprised that they are "new" since they seem like an obvious feature. You can reuse variables in a CSS stylesheet so that you can change them all at once. And, unlike Sass, the variables can change at runtime as the user interacts with the site. For instance, if there is a color slider on the screen, the user can use the slider to reset the variable on the fly.</p>
        <p>Google Dev Tools 2.0 are amazing! Most of this was over my head, but I did find it really cool that in the Chrome Console you can type out a function and Chrome automatically knows when you push enter if you want to just continue onto a new line or submit your content to a console. For instance if you type:</p>
        <p>"function myFunction(args) {"</p>
        <p>and then hit enter, the console is smart enough to just take you to the next line instead of submitting your code into the console to run. It will also indent and format everything automagically for the rest of the function until your closing curly bracket. Super!</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In the real world (not school), why you would write functions in the console or create breakpoints. Why wouldn't you just use repl or your actual js file?</li>
          <li>Why do companies pay for the pizza at these meetups? I can think of a few reasons (because the want Denver to be a cool tech environment? or they want for prospective employees to think they are cool?) but I'm not sure the real reason.</li>
          <li>What is Sass and should I be using it?</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Women of Galvanize Lunch <time datetime="2017-10-18">10/18/2017</time></h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
        <p>A lunch for all women of Galvanize to discuss interviews and women-specific challenges in Tech.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Michelle Bergquist - Michelle is a resident instructor at Galvanize, for cohort G64. She has experience in library science just like me.</li>
            <li>Kelsey - Kelsey is a student in G64. She was previously a bartender and is deep in a prject using angular.</li>
          </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>We reviewed 2 famous interview prompts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Tell me about yourself. </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Michelle's advice was to start with "My name is (name) and I'm a developer." Even if you are just starting out, you are a developer now.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is my answer: "My name is Emily and I'm a developer. I have a background in technical writing and a master's in library and information science. I'm interested in front end development, which connects my love of coding with my love of library science and user information seeking behavior. I want to work somewhere where I can be creative every day and find social and community fulfillment in the work that I do."
          </li>
          <li><strong>Tell me about a time you encountered a challenge and had to resolve it under a time constraint.</strong>
            <br>
            Michelle's advice was to use the acronym STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
            <br>
            "(Situation) I took a part time Javascript course prior to starting at Galvanize.(Task) For my final project I had to make a html page using javascript that connected to an external API. (Action) I made a Watchlist page called "Watch Watch" designed to let users create a list of movie and tv titles they wanted to save for later. My initial approach was to make one page for the list and another for searching. However, since I wasn't connected to a database I figured out that I needed to have everything work on one page. So I worked with my instructor who helped me realize that I could do it all on one page and just move text elements from one list to another list with CSS styles. I was able to go through stack overflow and use "display:none" and "display:hidden" and connect to different classes to make it appear like things were magically moving around on the page. (Result) I got everything done and I was proud of the result.

        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>

          <li>How does anyone stay calm enough during interviews to white board?</li>
