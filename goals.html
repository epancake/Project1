        <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>I completed the first HTML drill. It was really fun. Something that helped me be inspired to meet this goal was that I made my site Game of Thrones themed, and their content really added to my polished look and general joy while creating the site. In the spirit of "learn to learn" this form of "play" drove me to better results than if I had just used boring gray boxes and placeholder text throughout. This was a win for the day. Additionally, I let go of my competitive nature while doing this one in favor of doing it slowly and correctly. I think there were things that I would have missed (html validator, margins, etc.) if I had been trying to be the person that is the farthest ahead in the cohort.</li>
            <li>This goal is complete. I reviewed the rubric and I'm ready to go.</li>
            <li>I did not do as good at this goal as I'd hoped. I took "some" notes for each breakout, but I found that in order to fully engage I basically stoopped taking notes. I occasionally wrote down things that were hard, or hot keys that I want to remember. Tomorrow, I think that I will not continue this note taking goal, but rather compile a list of resources that were provided in the day, and keep this as a running list. I also need to keep a running list of hot keys. This will be easier to use to retreive information rather than many many different notes in Evernote.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Overall Reflection: I think the goals I set were good, particularly in the order I laid them out. The harder and tougher goal was first and it was good to have that priority defined for the day. In the future, I should continue to prioritize the tough goals if I really want to get the most substantial results from my efforts.

        <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't drive to school.</li>
            <li>Plan a meetup to go to this week.</li>
            <li>Complete all HTML reading.</li>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>I took the bus to school! This was actually really stressful and I think I would have been better off riding my bike. I figured out that the time RTD tells you that you need for "walking" must be based around some giants with mile long legs because I had to really hustle to make it on time to school. Nevertheless, I completed my goal and now I know to take the 8:06 bus instead of the 8:12 bus. The reason that I set this goal was to save money ($10/day on parking is too glutonous), and I think riding my bike will save MORE money and also let me get in some exercise, AND be faster. In the future, my goal should more directly reflect my end need, which in this case is to not spend money on transporting my body to school, rather than the lower-level requirement of "don't drive to school." Riding the bus is $5.20 so the bike is a better way to meet this actual goal. In the future, my goals should more closely reflect the root of the need/desire rather than one route to acheive that need.
            </li>
            <li>I RSVP'd to a meetup tomorrow called the monthly DenverScript meetup. It is tomorrow. The goal has been met! I think it will be a good stepping stone to meetups (it's my 2nd ever meetup) because a bunch of buddies from the cohort are going. However, I will need to be careful not to just talk to people I know since networking is already uncomfortable for me. The next one will be different because a) I won't go in a big group and b) it will be on a topic that I pick for myself, which will make me more actively interested.</li>
            <li>I completed all the HTML reading! The goal was met. However, I noticed during the readings that they were all basically about content that I already knew, and I really could have skipped ahead on a lot of them. I can only think of one or two things that I actually learned. I think in the future I need to give myself room or forgiveness for revaluating and creating different goals if I find out that the landscape of information is different than I expected. For instance, I think it would have been more valuable for me to watch Kyle's video of HTML layout rather than read the "Learn" content. I could have just skimmed the Learn, or used it as a reference for later. I also was so focused on completing the goal that I didn't take notes, because I felt like I really had to read without distractions, which is not actually the best way for me to learn. I guess you could say that I did not allow myself to "Play" with the content because I was so focused on completing the reading. After I complete the drills, I will know if this strategy was helpful or could be revised for the future. Allowing myself to change my goals mught be a slippery slope, but I think in this case it would have helped me accomplish an ongoing goal of staying on pace with the class.</li>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Get Jquery into my personal site before my presentation at the end of the day</li>
            <li>Present my personal site looking like a calm person (measured by not talking so fast that I'm out of breath, and remembering that anxiety is a cousin of excitement)</li>
            <li>Talk to somebody new</li>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <ol>
            <li> My "About Me" site has jQuery, the goal was met! I added a function that allows me to flip back and forth between my name and my nickname. I think this was a great success. Instead of watching all the the jQuery tutorials, I stopped when I had enough info to complete my goal, which worked well given my time constraint of presenting my site later that day.</li>
            <li>My goal was halfway met. I think I looked pretty calm. I began to run out of breath once early on, but I slowed down and it wasn't an issue. I did not use my mantra that "anxiety is a cousin of excitement." I forgot, which may have been because I did not have as much anxiety as I anticipated. I do however, think that I overloaded my audience with information and did not have enough eye contact. My focus on not looking nervous diminished my ability to engage with the audience. Next time I think maybe I can write a sign on my computer reminding me to look up and interact with the audience.</li>
            <li>My goal was met! I went to lunch with a new group including Mike, who I hadn't talked with before. I talked to him about his experience at Turing and got to know him a little bit. He seems like he's really happy to help people and was also interested in the javascript stuff that I learned in my web dev for javascript course. It's important to me to be approachable by everyone in the class and similarly to be able to approach them, and my actions at lunch help me to reach that goal.</li>
